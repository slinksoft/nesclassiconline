# nesclassiconline
A web project that I brought back after abandoning it 2 years ago. Replicates the NES Classic UI and plays all 20 NES games that were included in the console.

This was developed with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript (jQuery and AJAX). The provided emulator is by EmulatorJS developers (https://www.emulatorjs.com/).

NOTE: You will have to find all the ROMS yourself and name them accordingly with the source code. This is due to copyright reasons. I further discuss this in the video provided at 7:20.
